# [HTTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-introduction)

# Web server :

A web server is a software or hardware system that serves web content to clients over the internet or an intranet. It handles HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests from clients (typically web browsers) and provides the appropriate responses, usually in the form of web pages (HTML), images, scripts, or other media.

Here are some key aspects and functions of a web server:

1. **Handling Requests**: The primary role of a web server is to listen for incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests from clients and respond to them appropriately. This involves accepting a connection, reading the request, processing it, and sending back the appropriate response.

2. **Serving Content**: Web servers serve various types of content, such as HTML documents, images, stylesheets (CSS), JavaScript files, video, and other multimedia. They can serve static content directly from the file system or dynamic content generated by server-side scripts.

3. **Processing Dynamic Content**: Many web servers can interface with server-side scripting languages (such as PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js) to generate dynamic content. For instance, when a request for a PHP page is received, the web server passes the request to the PHP interpreter, processes the script, and returns the output to the client.

4. **Managing Connections**: Web servers manage multiple connections simultaneously, often using multithreading or asynchronous I/O to handle many requests at once. This is crucial for maintaining performance and responsiveness, especially under heavy load.

5. **Security Features**: Web servers support various security features, such as HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for encrypted communication, authentication, access control, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.).

6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Web servers typically include logging features to record details about incoming requests, errors, and other significant events. These logs are valuable for troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and security auditing.

### Popular Web Servers

1. **Apache HTTP Server**: One of the most widely used web servers, known for its robustness, flexibility, and extensive module support. It is open-source and supports various features like URL redirection, authentication, and more.

2. **Nginx**: Known for its high performance, scalability, and low resource consumption, Nginx is often used for serving static content and as a reverse proxy for load balancing and handling dynamic requests.

3. **Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)**: A web server created by Microsoft, primarily used on Windows servers. It integrates well with other Microsoft products and supports a wide range of features for enterprise environments.

4. **LiteSpeed**: A high-performance web server known for its speed and efficiency, often used as an alternative to Apache with compatible configuration files.

5. **Caddy**: A modern web server that is easy to configure and use, with automatic HTTPS by default.

### How a Web Server Works

1. **Client Request**: The process starts when a client (e.g., a web browser) makes a request to the web server. This request is typically initiated by entering a URL in the browser's address bar or by clicking on a link.

2. **DNS Resolution**: The domain name in the URL is resolved to an IP address via the Domain Name System (DNS).

3. **Connection Establishment**: The client establishes a TCP connection with the web server using the resolved IP address and port 80 (for HTTP) or port 443 (for HTTPS).

4. **Request Handling**: The client sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying the desired resource (e.g., a web page, image, or script).

5. **Response Generation**: The web server processes the request, retrieves the requested resource (or generates it dynamically), and sends an HTTP response back to the client.

6. **Connection Termination**: Depending on the HTTP version and headers, the connection may be closed immediately after the response is sent, or it may be kept open for further requests (persistent connections).

By efficiently handling these steps, a web server ensures that users can access and interact with web content quickly and reliably.

# `ssize_t` is a data type used in C and C++ programming, particularly in Unix-like operating systems. It is used to represent the sizes of blocks that can be read or written in a single operation. It is essentially the signed counterpart to `size_t`.

### Key Points about `ssize_t`

1. **Signed Type**: size_t is an unsigned integer data type that is defined in various header files such as: `<stddef.h>, <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <time.h>, <wchar.h>` Itâ€™s a type which is used to represent the size of objects in bytes and is therefore used as the return type by the sizeof operator. It is guaranteed to be big enough to contain the size of the biggest object the host system can handle.
2. **Return Type for System Calls**: `ssize_t` is commonly used as the return type for functions that perform I/O operations, such as `read`, `write`, and `recv`.
   - These functions return the number of bytes read or written.
   - A negative return value indicates an error (e.g., `-1`).
3. **Size Representation**: The type `ssize_t` is typically the same size as `size_t`, but signed. This means it can represent values in the range from `-1` to `SSIZE_MAX` (where `SSIZE_MAX` is typically equal to `SIZE_MAX / 2`).

### Example Usage in Network Programming

When you use functions like `recv`, the return type is `ssize_t` because it needs to indicate both the number of bytes received and potential error conditions.

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int sockfd;
    char buffer[1024];
    ssize_t bytes_received;

    // Assume sockfd is a valid socket descriptor
    bytes_received = recv(sockfd, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);

    if (bytes_received < 0) {
        std::cerr << "Error receiving data\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Received " << bytes_received << " bytes\n";
    }

    return 0;
}

```

# CRLF/HTTP Formate

- ## HTTP Response :

  ```
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
  Content-Type: text/html\r\n
  Content-Length: 23\r\n
  \r\n
  <html>\r\n
  <body>\r\n
  Hello, World!\r\n
  </body>\r\n
  </html>\r\n
  ```

  The headers are:

  1. `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
  2. `Content-Type: text/html`
  3. `Content-Length: 23`

  The body starts after the blank line (`\r\n\r\n`). So, the body in this example is:

  ```
  <html>\r\n
  <body>\r\n
  Hello, World!\r\n
  </body>\r\n
  </html>\r\n
  ```

  Headers and body are separated by the double `\r\n`, which indicates the end of the headers and the beginning of the body.

- ## HTTP Request

  An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to a web server to request resources such as HTML pages, images, or data from a database. The structure of an HTTP request includes several key components:

  1. **Request Line**: Specifies the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST), the resource being requested (URL), and the HTTP version.
  2. **Headers**: Provide additional information about the request, such as the type of data being sent, the client's user-agent, and other metadata.
  3. **Body**: Contains the data being sent to the server (only present in methods like POST, PUT, etc.).

  ### Structure of an HTTP Request

  #### 1. Request Line

  The request line includes:

  - **HTTP Method**: The action to be performed (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - **Request-URI**: The path to the resource.
  - **HTTP Version**: The version of the HTTP protocol being used (e.g., HTTP/1.1).

  #### 2. Headers

  HTTP headers provide additional information about the request. Common headers include:

  - **Host**: The domain name of the server.
  - **User-Agent**: Information about the client (e.g., browser type and version).
  - **Accept**: The types of responses the client can accept (e.g., text/html, application/json).
  - **Content-Type**: The media type of the body of the request (used in POST and PUT requests).

  #### 3. Body

  The body of the request is used to send data to the server. This is typically used in POST, PUT, and PATCH requests.

  ### Example of an HTTP Request

  Here's an example of an HTTP GET request to fetch a webpage:

  ```
  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36
  Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
  Connection: keep-alive
  ```

  In this example:

  - **GET**: The HTTP method, indicating that the client wants to retrieve the resource.
  - **/index.html**: The resource being requested.
  - **HTTP/1.1**: The HTTP version.
  - **Host**: Specifies the domain name of the server.
  - **User-Agent**: Identifies the client software making the request.
  - **Accept**: Lists the types of content the client can process.
  - **Accept-Language**: Indicates the client's preferred languages.
  - **Accept-Encoding**: Specifies the content encodings the client can handle.
  - **Connection**: Controls whether the network connection stays open after the current transaction.

  ### Example of an HTTP POST Request

  Here's an example of an HTTP POST request to submit form data:

  ```
  POST /submit-form HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36
  Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Content-Length: 27
  Connection: keep-alive

  name=JohnDoe&age=30
  ```

  In this example:

  - **POST**: The HTTP method, indicating that the client wants to send data to the server.
  - **/submit-form**: The resource being targeted.
  - **Content-Type**: Indicates that the body content is form-encoded.
  - **Content-Length**: Specifies the length of the request body.
  - **Body**: Contains the form data (`name=JohnDoe&age=30`).

  ### Summary

  An HTTP request is a structured message that includes a request line, headers, and optionally, a body. The request line specifies the method, resource, and HTTP version. Headers provide additional metadata, and the body contains data sent to the server in methods like POST. Understanding the structure of HTTP requests is fundamental for web development and communication between clients and servers.

# User Agent header

- [Read Here..](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent)
- The User-Agent request header is a characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.
  Example :

```http
User-Agent: <product> / <product-version> <comment>

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (<system-information>) <platform> (<platform-details>) <extensions>

```

- `<product>` A product identifier â€” its name or development codename `<product-version>`
  Version number of the product.`<comment>`
  Zero or more comments containing more details. For example, sub-product information.

# Make File

A Makefile is a script that automates the compilation and linking process of software projects. It's particularly useful for managing projects with multiple source files or complex dependencies. Below are some key points about Makefiles along with an example:

### Key Points about Makefiles:

1. **Target-Dependency-Command Structure**:

   - Makefiles consist of rules with a target, dependencies, and commands.
   - Targets are the files or actions to be created.
   - Dependencies are the files required by the target.
   - Commands are the actions to be executed to produce the target.

2. **Automatic Dependency Tracking**:

   - Makefile allows automatic tracking of dependencies. If a source file changes, only the necessary components are recompiled.

3. **Efficiency**:

   - Makefile ensures that only the modified files are recompiled, which speeds up the compilation process.

4. **Flexibility**:

   - Makefiles support variables, conditionals, loops, and functions, making them flexible and adaptable to various project requirements.

5. **Portability**:
   - Makefiles are portable across different platforms and compilers, making them ideal for cross-platform development.

### Example Makefile:

```make
# Compiler
CC := g++

# Compiler flags
CFLAGS := -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11

# Source files
SRCS := main.cpp server.cpp HttpRequestHandler.cpp

# Object files
OBJS := $(SRCS:.cpp=.o)

# Executable name
EXEC := server

# Main target
all: $(EXEC)

# Rule to build the executable
$(EXEC): $(OBJS)
    $(CC) $(OBJS) -o $(EXEC)

# Rule to compile source files
%.o: %.cpp
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

# Clean rule
clean:
    rm -f $(OBJS) $(EXEC)
```

### Explanation:

- **CC**: Compiler to be used (here, `g++`).
- **CFLAGS**: Compiler flags, including warnings and C++ version.
- **SRCS**: List of source files.
- **OBJS**: List of object files derived from source files.
- **EXEC**: Name of the executable to be generated.
- **all**: Main target, builds the executable.
- **$(EXEC)**: Rule to build the executable, depends on object files.
- **$(OBJS)**: Rule to compile source files into object files.
- **clean**: Rule to remove generated object files and the executable.

### Usage:

1. Save the Makefile in the project directory.
2. Run `make` command in the terminal to compile the project.
3. Run `make clean` to remove generated files.

# Thread & MultiThreading

## Multithreading is a feature that allows concurrent or simultaneous execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU. Each part of such a program is called a thread. So, `Threads are lightweight processes within a process`.

## C++ 11 Provide std::thread and define in <thread> .

```cpp
    std::thread thread_object (pointer of function);
```

- std::thread is the thread class that represents a single thread in C++. To start a thread we simply need to create a new thread object and pass the executing code to be called (i.e, a callable object) into the constructor of the object. Once the object is created a new thread is launched which will execute the code specified in callable. A callable can be `Pointer of function` and other things.

### Examples :

```cpp
void foo(param)
{
  Statements;
}
// The parameters to the function are put after the comma
std::thread thread_obj(foo, params);
```

### Every Thread object must go through detach and join if not lead to error.

- ### Join

  - It waits or hault the program until that thread on which join function is called will complete it execution and then goes to next thread or if there is no other thread goes to main function thread.

  Example :

```cpp

    void foo(int Z)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < Z; i++) {
            cout << "Thread using function"
                    " pointer as callable\n";
        }
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(chrono:seconds(5));
    }


    int main()
    {
        cout << "Threads 1 "
                "operating independently"
            << endl;

        // This thread is launched by using
        // function pointer as callable
        thread th1(foo, 3);
        th1.join();
        return 0;
    }

```

- ### Detach

  - It is used to detach the newly created thread fromt the parent thread , Always check before detaching a thread that it is joinable otherwise we may end up double detaching and double detach willresult into program execution.

```cpp

    void foo(int Z)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < Z; i++) {
            cout << "Thread using function"
                    " pointer as callable\n";
        }
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(chrono:seconds(5));
    }


    int main()
    {
        cout << "Threads 1 "
                "operating independently"
            << endl;

        // This thread is launched by using
        // function pointer as callable
        thread th1(foo, 3);
        if(th1.joinale())
        {
            th1.detach();
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

- `To Compile Thread used code , you have to write `**g++ -c file_to_compiled.cpp -o Output_compiled_file.o -pthread** The -pthread flag in the g++ command is used to enable multithreading with the POSIX threads (pthreads) library in Linux.

## How to check Concurrent Connection :

To check if your server can handle concurrent connections, you need to perform a test that simulates multiple clients connecting to your server simultaneously. Here are a few methods to achieve this:

:4221/`: The URL of your server.

### 2. **Using `siege`**

`Siege` is another powerful tool for load testing and benchmarking your server.

First, install `siege`:

- On Debian-based systems:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install siege
  ```

Then run a test:

```sh
siege -c 10 -r 10 http://localhost:4221/
```

- `-c 10`: Number of concurrent users.
- `-r 10`: Number of repetitions for each user.

Certainly! Here's an explanation in simple language:

# Understanding `int argc, char **argv` in the `main` Function

When you write a C or C++ program, the `main` function is the starting point. Sometimes, you want your program to accept inputs from the command line. This is where `int argc` and `char **argv` come into play.

#### `int argc`

- `argc` stands for **argument count**.
- It tells you how many command-line arguments were passed to your program.
- This number includes the program's name itself.

For example:

```bash
./myprogram arg1 arg2
```

Here, `argc` would be 3 (`./myprogram`, `arg1`, `arg2`).

#### `char **argv`

- `argv` stands for **argument vector**.
- It is an array of pointers to strings (character arrays).
- Each element in this array is one of the command-line arguments.

In the same example:

```bash
./myprogram arg1 arg2
```

- `argv[0]` would be `"./myprogram"`
- `argv[1]` would be `"arg1"`
- `argv[2]` would be `"arg2"`

#### Putting It All Together

Here's a simple example of using `argc` and `argv` in a program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Number of arguments: %d\n", argc);
    for(int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

If you run this program with:

```bash
./myprogram first second third
```

The output will be:

```
Number of arguments: 4
Argument 0: ./myprogram
Argument 1: first
Argument 2: second
Argument 3: third
```

#### Summary

- `argc` gives the number of command-line arguments.
- `argv` is an array containing the actual arguments as strings.
- Use `argc` to know how many arguments there are.
- Use `argv` to access each argument.

### Understanding Content-Type in HTTP Responses

When a web server sends a response to a web browser, it includes various headers that provide information about the response. One important header is the `Content-Type`. This header tells the browser what kind of content it is receiving, so the browser knows how to display it correctly.

#### Common Content-Types:

1. **text/html**: HTML content. The browser will render this as a web page.
2. **text/plain**: Plain text. The browser will display this as simple text.
3. **application/json**: JSON data. The browser or a web application will process this as JSON.
4. **image/jpeg**: JPEG image. The browser will display this as an image.
5. **application/octet-stream**: Binary data. The browser will typically prompt to download this file.

#### How to Use Content-Type in Your Server Code

To ensure the browser handles the response correctly (e.g., displaying it instead of downloading it), you need to set the `Content-Type` header appropriately in your HTTP responses.

Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this in a C++ HTTP server:

1. **Include the `Content-Type` header in the response based on the type of content being served.**
2. **Use different content types for different types of responses (HTML, plain text, binary files, etc.).**

#### Example Code with Proper Content-Types

Hereâ€™s your code, modified to set the correct `Content-Type` headers:

### Summary

- **Content-Type Header**: Informs the browser about the type of content in the response.
- **Setting Content-Type**: Ensure the content is displayed correctly by setting the right `Content-Type` for HTML, plain text, JSON, images, etc.
- **Example Code**: Shows how to set the `Content-Type` header for different types of responses in a C++ HTTP server.

This explanation should be sufficient to understand and implement the proper use of `Content-Type` in HTTP responses.

# HTTP Compression

- Whenever Browser sends request to web server it also mention which encoding or compression machanism it accepts , in accept part of HTTP request Header section.
  So, Basicaly it is a file compression mechanish used by web server to reduce the size of files they are serving for a request.
- Types of encoding mechanism Gzip,deflate , hoffman encoding etc.
- An HTTP client uses the Accept-Encoding header to specify the compression schemes it supports. In the following example, the client specifies that it supports the gzip compression scheme:

```
> GET /echo/foo HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:4221
> User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
> Accept: */*
> Accept-Encoding: gzip  // Client specifies it supports the gzip compression scheme.
```

The server then chooses one of the compression schemes listed in Accept-Encoding and compresses the response body with it.

Then, the server sends a response with the compressed body and a Content-Encoding header. Content-Encoding specifies the compression scheme that was used.

In the following example, the response body is compressed with gzip:

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Encoding: gzip    // Server specifies that the response body is compressed with gzip.
< Content-Type: text/plain  // Original media type of the body.
< Content-Length: 23        // Size of the compressed body.
< ...                       // Compressed body.
```
